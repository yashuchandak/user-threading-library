main bhi ek thread hai kya?
thread 1 tread 2 aur main chal raha
thread 1 exit, mai setcontext(main) karta to thread 1 main execute karna shuru karti aur thread 2 aur main to already chal rahe?


thread_exit ka ret val ptr ?
The  pthread_exit()  function  terminates the calling thread and returns a value via retval
       that (if the thread is joinable) is available to another thread in the  same  process  that
       calls pthread_join(3).

aur thread_join me **retval?
 
relation?

The return value of the thread terminated by pthread_exit() function is accessible in the second argument of the pthread_join 


scheduling in one-one nhi na?

====================
pthread_exit() will exit the thread that calls it.

In your case since the main calls it, main thread will terminate whereas your spawned threads will continue to execute. This is mostly used in cases where the main thread is only required to spawn threads and leave the threads to do their job

pthread_join will suspend execution of the thread that has called it unless the target thread terminates

This is useful in cases when you want to wait for thread/s to terminate before further processing in main thread.
